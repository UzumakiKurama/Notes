# What is Execution Context ? 
Let's say that our js code is now compiled and ready to be executed. 

In the beginning only the code that resides outside of the functions is executed which makes sense since functions should only be executed when they are called. 
+ A Global Execution Context is created for the top level code. Top level code refers to function/varibale declartions, function expressions etc.
An execution context can be thought of as a enviorment which executes a piece of js code, it contains all the neccessary information required for execution.
