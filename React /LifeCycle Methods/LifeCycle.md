# LifeCycle Methods
A component lifecycle has three phases. These lifecycle methods are used only inside class based components. 
It is advised to use functional components, where we can use hooks to perform actions that are done using lifecycle methods in class based components. 


<span style="color:red">Mounting Phase</span> 
: It refers to the period when components are created and inserted into the DOM

<span style="color:red">Updating Phase</span>
: It refers to the period when the properties or state of the component changes due to some user actions and it needs to be updated in the DOM.

<span style="color:red;">Unmounting Phase</span>
: The unmounting phase refers to the lifecycle stage when a component is being removed from the DOM (Document Object Model) and is no longer rendered or accessible.
