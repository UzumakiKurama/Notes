# Redux
Redux is a read-only state management library. It is mostly used in conjunction with react but it's not limited to react, can be used with other frontend libraries also like Vue, Angular etc.

In simpler terms redux can be thought of as a centralized store which keeps all the application data that can be accessed by any component.
